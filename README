DESCRIPTION:

SensorX is a breakout board designed to make it easy to integrate sensors to the analog 
inputs of RaceCapture. 

7 channels are supported to match the inputs of RaceCapture. Pullup resistors are included 
on all channels to enable resistive sensors such as temperature & fuel level; these resistors 
can be disabled by cutting traces.

Multiple ground and 5v voltage references are also provided.

The board is sized to be finished with shrink-tubing and installed in-line with wiring harness
bundles, so no explicit mounting or enclosures are necessary!
