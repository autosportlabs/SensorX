DESCRIPTION:

SensorX is a breakout board to help integrate sensors to the analog inputs of RaceCapture. 

7 analog inputs are supported. Pullup resistors are included to support resistive sensors such as
temperature & fuel level; these resistors can be disabled by cutting traces.

Multiple ground and 5v voltage references are also provided.

The board is sized to be finished with shrink-tubing and installed in-line with wiring harness bundles
